# QUESTIONS
# 1. Think about what could be going wrong with our calculation. 
# Think about a better way to evaluate this data. 
# 2. What metric would you report for this dataset?
# 3. What is its value?

# First I'll convert variables into factors and dates
dt$created_at <- as.POSIXct(dt$created_at, "%m/%d/%Y %H:%M:%S")    
dt$payment_method <- as.factor(dt$payment_method)

# Then I'll look at the summary statistics for the dataset
summary(dt) #See that there are outliers in order_amount and total_items
# This can indicate that the AOV is higher than expected because of some
# extreme values
boxplot(dt$order_amount) # Viewing outliers
boxplot(dt$total_items) # Viewing outliers


# Another way to evaluate the data would be to split up the order_amounts by shop_id
# Check AOV per shop_id
dt1<- subset(dt, shop_id %in% 1)
AOV_Shop1 <- mean(dt1$order_amount)
#See that shop 1 has a much lower mean


# Apply for all shops
dt2 <- aggregate(dt[, 4], list(dt$shop_id), mean)
names(dt2)[1] <- "shop_id"
names(dt2)[2] <- "AOV"
dt2
# Key findings: shop_id 42 and 78 have drastically higher AOV.


# Check whether or not the weeks have an effect on AOV
dt3 <- dt
dt3$created_at <- format(dt3$created_at, '%Y-%U')

PlotData = dt3 %>% group_by(created_at) %>%
  summarise(yearlyAverage = mean(order_amount))

plot1 <- ggplot(PlotData, aes(x=factor(created_at), y = yearlyAverage)) +
  geom_point(alpha=0.6, size=2)+
  labs(
    title = "Weekly Average Order Value",
    x = "Week",
    y = "Average Order Value") 
plot1
# Key findings: Week 10 in 2017 saw a drastically lower AOV.
# However this plot is skewed because of the few extreme values
# We can take a look at the weekly average AOV without shops 42 and 78

newdata <- dt[ !(dt$shop_id %in% c(42, 78)), ]
newdata$created_at <- format(newdata$created_at, '%Y-%U')

PlotData1 = newdata %>% group_by(created_at) %>%
  summarise(yearlyAverage = mean(order_amount))

plot2 <- ggplot(PlotData1, aes(x=factor(created_at), y = yearlyAverage)) +
  geom_point(alpha=0.6, size=2)+
  labs(
    title = "Weekly Average Order Value",
    x = "Week",
    y = "Average Order Value") 
plot2
# Key findings: Week 11 in 2017 had the highest AOV


# We can also look at total items purchased per shop_id
dt4 <- aggregate(dt[, 5], list(dt$shop_id), mean)
names(dt4)[1] <- "shop_id"
names(dt4)[2] <- "average_total_items"
dt4
# Key findings: Store 42 has an average of 667 items purchased per transaction
# which is way above average.

# ANSWER
# 1. Think about what could be going wrong with our calculation. 
# -> extreme values are skewing the AOV
# Think about a better way to evaluate this data. 
# -> look at AOV based on shop_id
# -> look at AOV based on the week ending
# What metric would you report for this dataset?
# -> a metric that tells us the order_amount per shop_id, the total_items per
# shop_id, and the average weekly AOV
# What is its value?
# -> dt2 is the average order amount per shop id
# -> dt4 is the average item ordered per shop id
# -> plot1 shows the AOV per week. However plot1 may be skewed because of the extreme values
# -> plot 2 shows the AOV per week excluding purchases from stores 42 and 78
